# Pixel-Sorting
A Python-based program that takes an input image and returns an output image where the pixels have been sorted based on user input.

The program can sort across both the x and y axis, with either a descending or ascending sort. The program uses the r, g or b values of each pixel to determine the order of which they are sorted.
#
### To do:
- [ ] Replace bubble sort with an algorithm that scales better,
- [ ] Limit how large the Pygame window can be so that large images do not cover a user's entire screen space,
- [ ] Implement a system for allowing the window to be resized during runtime, while maintaining its aspect ratio,
- [ ] Implement support for more sort values,
